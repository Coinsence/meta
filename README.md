# Coinsence

Coinsence is a collaboration platform that allows communities to issue their own tokens to mobilize people, engage resources and reward contributions. 

This is meta product development repository containing: 

- [Technical Docs](https://github.com/Coinsence/meta/tree/master/docs)
- [Technical Development issues](https://github.com/Coinsence/meta/issues)

To test the current solution, everybody is welcome to join the network via their email adress under www.coinsence.org

Basically, HumHub - Open Source Social Network is enhanced with further modules enabling: 
- spaces (communities, projects, organizations) to issue their own space coins. 
- spaces to create internal accounts which can be managed by different users.
- user to create own accounts.
- user to perform transactions of coins between different accounts.
- spaces can create tasks and allocate specifoc coins to the tasks.
- spaces to collect coins via. crowd-funding. 
- User and spaces to share resources, goods, products and services in a common marketplace. 

*What is the benefit of crowd-fund?*
Crowdfunding enables spaces to exchange coins as instrument to exchange value. Further more, crowd-funding enables community members to decide collectively over investment and project support e.g. which projects shall receive community coins.  
Via crowd-funding, projects (e.g. space_X) can get community coins (space_Y coins) which they can use to get resources from the marketplace. In exchange, space_Y distributes during crowd-funding process space_Y coins to crowd-investors. User can allocate space_Y coins to space_X and get in exchange space_X coins.
Space_Y can also distribute space_Y coins to other contributors. 
Space_Y coins show the contribution of other spaces and users to Space_Y. The coins which are a proof-of-contribution can be used later to track voluntary contributions or as proof-of-investment to map later equity and revenue share to the different contributing members and groups.

What is the benefit of the marketplace?
Communities can share resources via. the marketplace. User making offers in the marketplace can set the price in a specific space coins as exchange unit or can set the discount they offer in exchange of specific space coins.

To ensure data integrity and interoperability, Coinsence uses Ethereum as decentral common ledger to store and exchange token (coins). 

An independent android mobile application for transactions is also deployed in the playstore under coinsence.
